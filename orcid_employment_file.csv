Marc,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Miller,NA,,0000-0002-5316-8515,"Marc L. Miller is the Dean & Ralph W. Bilby Professor of Law at the University of Arizona College of Law. Dean Miller taught at Emory University Law School from 1988-2005, where he served as Associate Dean for Faculty and Scholarship (2003-2005). He is a graduate of the University of Chicago Law School and Pomona College, and grew up in Los Angeles.

Dean Miller writes and teaches about environmental law and policy and criminal law and policy. He is the author of more than 70 articles and essays on a wide range of environmental, criminal justice, immigration and legal theory topics. He is editor of several casebooks on criminal procedure and sentencing, and co-founded the Federal Sentencing Reporter, the leading journal on sentencing law and policy and a joint project of the Vera Institute of Justice and the University of California Press. He currently serves as a series editor for Summits - books focused on the intersection of environmental science, law, and policy.

Dean Miller's scholarship addresses the nature of law. On the criminal side, current work includes a series of articles on the role and regulation of prosecutorial discretion, including a multi-year empirical evaluation of prosecutorial decision-making. At a more general theoretical level, this work deals with policymaking within executive branch agencies, especially in those areas not readily amenable to external judicial or legislative review. His environmental work highlights topics at the intersection of environmental science, policy, and law with special attention to the concept of sustainability and to the relationship between science and environmental policy-making. Much of his environmental work is done in collaboration with natural and social scientists.

At Arizona, Dean Miller serves as co-director of the Arizona Law Program in Criminal Law and Policy, and has joint and affiliated appointments with the University of Arizona Institute of the Environment, the Environmental Health Sciences Program of the University of Arizona Zuckerman School of Public Health, and with the Global Change PhD minor, among other programs and institutes. He serves on various university committees, including a workgroup through the McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship at the Eller College of Management to create a new Masters program focusing on capitalizing ventures. He also serves on the steering committee developing a new graduate degree certificate program in American Indian natural resource, and as Associate Director for Interdisciplinary Education for the Arizona Telemedicine Program.

Before teaching, Dean Miller served as law clerk to Chief Judge John Godbold of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, as Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice, and as Special Counsel at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York. Dean Miller has been a visiting professor at Stanford Law School and Duke Law School. Dean Miller is a member of the American Law Institute (ALI), and an advisor to various criminal justice and environmental publications and organizations.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,grid.134563.6,GRID,James E.

Darren,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Cusanovich,NA,,0000-0001-6889-0095,"I am a genome scientist at the University of Arizona. My lab is interested in understanding how the human genome regulates itself to bring about all of the cellular diversity present in our bodies. In addition, we are interested in how genetic variation and environmental exposures in human populations impact that regulation and sometimes lead to complex disease. The particular disease model that we focus on is asthma, a complex disease affecting ~10-20% of the population. The reasons we think that single-cell approaches would be particularly applicable to asthma are: (1) the disease involves complex interactions between many cell types of the lung and immune system that are difficult to model; And (2) there are several exquisitely detailed examples of gene-environment interactions that influence asthma outcomes many years later, but we still know relatively little about the molecular mechanisms that lead from exposure to disease. To study these phenomena, we use single-cell genomics technologies so that we can evaluate the impact of genetic and environmental variability from the perspective of whole tissues rather than having to isolate individual cell types or use simplistic cellular models. Working at the nexus of functional genomics, computational biology, and cellular biology, our group is both experimental and computational and often has to develop novel technologies or methods to address our research questions.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,grid.134563.6,GRID,Cellular and Molecular Medicine,Assistant Professor,NA,1,public,2022-02-26,2021,11,15,NA,NA,NA

Ahmed,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Gamil,Gamil A,,0000-0002-7314-7746,"Currently, Mr. Gamil is a Ph.D. candidate at the aerospace and mechanical engineering department, at the University of Arizona. His area of research is thermo-fluid sciences, particularly working on performance analysis and modeling of novel concentrated solar-thermal power (CSP) systems and focusing on solar tower technology for heat supply in industrial applications. His work includes design, optimization, and techno-economic modeling for the main sub-systems (i.e., receiver, collector, heat exchanger, thermal energy storage).

Ahmed has obtained his BEng. and MSc in mechanical engineering from PETRONAS University of Technology (UTP) in Malaysia. His passion for energy saving and environmental protection drove him to continue his studies in the renewable energy field. He has chosen Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technologies to be the area of research where a fully-funded (STIRF 51/2011) project was ready to commence at UTP in 2012. Ahmed was among the few students who were selected to join that project as a researcher and MSc candidate.

His MSc. project was “Simulation and Performance Analysis of a Small Scale Heliostat Field at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS”. The project's main aim is to evaluate the solar thermal power output of a small heliostat field under Malaysia's climate for electricity generation as a preliminary phase to building a Solar Power Tower plant in Malaysia. The study had both simulation and experimental approaches. As a researcher during his Msc candidacy, he did carry out an extensive literature review on Solar Systems focusing on shortages and feasible improvements, especially in collectors and receiver sub-systems. This research work has raised his awareness of sustainability and energy security where he practically applied his knowledge in the field. During that tenure, he worked as a teaching assistant and tutored several undergraduate energy courses for 2 years (i.e. Alternative energy, Energy Conversion and Management, Refrigeration, and Air conditioning). He also prepared, submitted, and presented 3 scientific papers published in IOP (Institute of Physics, UK), Google Scholar, Scopus, and IEEE. Over the years, I developed exceptional skills using CAD software (SOLIDWORKS and CATIA V5), TRNSYS, Soltrace, and SAM for Bsc and Msc projects as well as training many students to use them for their endeavors.

His motivation towards continuous learning and development allowed him to secure a part-time job as a lecturer at the University of Bahri, Sudan, lecturing four modules in 2 years, namely: Computer Aided Drawing (CAD), Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), Heat and Mass Transfer, Health Safety and Environment.

In 2017, Ahmed was among the few applicants who were finalists applying for the Fulbright Scholarship announced at the US embassy in Sudan. He was offered a placement as visiting researcher at the University of Arizona, Tucson under the supervisor of Professor Peiwen Li (Perry) at the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering department. The United States government through the Fulbright Foreign Program has funded his study which mainly focused on: modeling and optimizing an innovative solar tower system with unique heliostat features to reduce costs, developing the proposed method using coding programs such as SolarPILOT and System Adviser Model (SAM), further analysis to determine the best-fit layout of the solar tower using biomimetic patterns.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,AZ,US,8041,RINGGOLD,Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering ,Fulbright Researcher,NA,0,public,2018-08-14,2018,01,01,NA,NA,NA

Richard,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Snodgrass,NA,,0000-0003-4703-7460,"Richard (Rick) Snodgrass is a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. He joined that Department in 1989. His research interests include temporal databases, query language design, query optimization and evaluation, storage structures and database design. Rick was named an ACM Fellow in 1999.

Rick chaired the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD) from 1997 to 2001. As a member of the SIG Governing Board, he led the movement to align the SIGs, both intellectually and financially, behind the goal of broadening the ACM Digital Library into a portal. He argued effectively that adding citation pages for all computing literature to the Digital Library would reap great rewards for ACM, for ACM's members, and for the research community at large. Today, the Digital Library with over 850,000 citation pages, is a gem in the crown of ACM.

Rick's other ACM activities include co-chairing the History Committee, chairing the Publications Board, serving on Council, and chairing the Advisory Board of SIGMOD. He is the current Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Database Systems and has served as an Associate Editor of the International Journal on Very Large Databases and the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.

Rick's conference activities include chairing the Americas program committee for the 2001 VLDB Conference and the program committees for the 1994 SIGMOD Conference and the 1993 International Workshop on an Infrastructure for Temporal Databases. In addition, he has served as a vice-chair or member of many database conference program committees. Rick received the ACM SIGMOD Contribution Award in 2002.

Her work in planetary dynamics has spanned a wide variety of topics, including extra-solar planets and debris disks around nearby stars, the formation and evolution of the Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt, the orbital resonances amongst the moons of the giant planets, and the meteoritic bombardment history of the planets. She has revolutionized our understanding of the history of the solar system by using the orbital resonance between Pluto and Neptune to infer large-scale orbital migration of the giant planets and to predict the existence of the ""Plutinos"" and other small planets in resonance with Neptune. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has been the recipient of honors and awards from the American Astronomical Society, the International Astronomical Union, The University of Arizona, and the IIT-Delhi.

Ryane,2018-11-07,2018-11-07,Englar,NA,,0000-0002-7184-4978,"Ryane E. Englar, DVM, DABVP (Canine and Feline Practice) is a 2008 graduate of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Following graduation, she spent five years as an associate veterinarian in small animal practice, split between her home state of Maryland and her home-away-from-home, upstate New York.  She then became a Clinical Instructor of the Community Practice Service at Cornell’s Companion Animal Hospital and a Consultant for the Louis J. Camuti Hotline in association with Cornell’s Feline Health Center. 

In February 2014, Dr. Englar relocated to Arizona, where she was privileged to be founding faculty for Midwestern University College of Veterinary Medicine. As an Assistant Professor of Small Animal Primary Care, she designed and debuted the communications coursework for the inaugural class of 2018. By developing 27 standardized client encounters over eight pre-clinical quarters, she was able to expand the breadth and depth of standardized client encounters in the veterinary curriculum. Her experiences in simulation-based education have been detailed in her active publication history with the Journal of Veterinary Medical Education. 

Dr. Englar joined the faculty at Kansas State University in May 2017 to build the clinical skills curriculum for first and second year veterinary students. Her coursework emphasizes hands-on training with the opportunity for practice and repetition to build those clinical and professional skills that promote Day-One-Ready graduates. Her interests in the design and development of non-animal teaching models have led her and her team to create novel learning opportunities for her students.

Dr. Englar joined the faculty of the University of Arizona College of Veterinary Medicine in February 2020 to design and debut the Clinical and Professional Skills series of courses in August 2020, when the Inaugural Class of 2023 arrives on campus.

Professor Griffin teaches Civil Procedure, Remedies, and Empirical Methods in the Law. His research empirically investigates whether ideas for enhancing access to justice work or don’t. Professor Griffin and his colleagues primarily use randomized control trials to evaluate the causal effects of existing and innovative solutions for narrowing the justice gap. Most of these studies focus on the civil justice system, including the efficacy of unbundled legal services in housing court, the value of connecting survivors of intimate partner violence to civil legal aid, and the potential promise of non-lawyer models of legal services provision. Professor Griffin is also involved in randomized evaluations of criminal pretrial risk assessments. His work has appeared in the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, the Utah Law Review, and the William & Mary Law Review.

He holds a B.S. in International Political Economy, magna cum laude, from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, where he was a John Carroll Scholar and a Beinecke Scholar; an MPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford, where he was an Albritton Scholar; and a J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Law & Policy Review.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,grid.134563.6,GRID,James E.

Lisa,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Majuta,NA,,0000-0002-7690-2356,"I have over 30 years of rodent surgical experience in Industry and Academics using a variety of different animal models and I am committed to excellence in research and mentoring others in proper surgical and laboratory technique. I began my research career performing an independent study project in embryology while still an undergraduate at Northern Arizona University (NAU). This was my introduction into the world of laboratory science and sparked my interest in academic research. After graduating from NAU, I was briefly employed at Steris Laboratories (a pharmaceutical company in Phoenix AZ) after which I moved to Tucson to join the lab of Dr. Charles Tipton in the department of Physiology at the University of Arizona. While working with Dr. Tipton, I developed and refined my surgical and experimental techniques by conducting oxygen consumption and weightlessness experiments in rats undergoing various exercise/training programs. After Dr. Tipton’s retirement, I was fortunate to join the laboratory of Dr. Frank Porreca in the department of Pharmacology. Initially, I worked with Dr. Pierre Riviere (Ferring Inc., San Diego, CA) establishing a uterine contraction model in rats to test the efficacy of novel compounds for the treatment of preterm labor contractions. This study resulted in a compound that is now in stage 3 clinical trials. My next challenge was to establish a mouse model of bone cancer pain, fashioned after the model developed in the Mantyh lab, for use in Dr. Porreca’s and Dr. Tamara King’s laboratories. This model is still in use today. My final project for Dr. Porreca was to help develop and validate a new model of headache pain in the rat. I contributed a novel surgical approach for the administration of inflammatory mediators onto the dura of the brain of an awake and freely moving rat and performed experiments alongside Rebecca Edelmayer (who later obtained her Ph.D. with our findings). I next joined Dr. Patrick Mantyh’s laboratory as a Behavioral Specialist. In my time working for Dr. Mantyh, I have organized the animal surgeries and designed, performed, and supervised experiments conducted by the behavioral group for both the cancer-induced and bone fracture pain studies. Since joining Dr. Mantyh’s lab, I have been first author on 4 published articles in scientific journals with one cover for PAIN. Upon Dr. Mantyh’s retirement, I was fortunate to join Dr. Arthur Riegel in his lab to assist in the determination of a novel target for drug development to treat heroin and cocaine addiction. I’m currently using the rodent self-administration model to search for treatments for addiction in addition to overseeing many aspects of the rat and mouse behavioral studies. I have acquired a better understanding of the processes involved in the advancement of academic research and realized my goal of becoming a more versatile scientist.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,AZ,US,https://ror.org/03m2x1q45,ROR,Pharmacology,Research Scientist III,NA,1,public,2023-02-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mohammad,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Shahidullah,NA,,0000-0002-1142-4242,"Since August 1983 I had an uninterrupted career in teaching and research and worked with 5 different Universities in Asia, Europe and America. I published more than 50 peer reviewed articles in many reputed journals and contributed significantly to the field of ocular Physiology and Pharmacology.

I graduated with Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree in 1982 from Bangladesh Agricultural University. I was awarded University Prize for securing First position in the First Class. I was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology in the following year. During the tenure of my lectureship position I completed MSc in Pharmacology degree in 1985, again with distinction and secured First Class. I was promoted to Assistant professor in 1987 and worked in this position until Sept.
1990.

In 1990 I was awarded Commonwealth Scholarship by the Association of Universities in the United Kingdom to study PhD in Pharmacology. Strictly speaking this is the start of my research career. I completed PhD in 1994 from the University of Glasgow, UK and because of my outstanding contribution in research I was immediately offered Postdoc position and worked for this University until 2001. During this period I had an outstanding achievement in establishing an experimental model, the perfused intact eye system to study ocular drugs. I published a number of manuscripts utilizing this model system with significant contribution to the field.

In 2001 I was invited by the School of Optometry of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to help them establish an Ocular Pharmacology laboratory and appointed me as a Research Fellow and Visiting Lecturer. I worked there until June 2005. There I was able to adapt the intact eye preparation to record multifocal ERG and this was the first in vitro ERG record in the world. In this position, I also taught Pharmacology and Physiology to optometry students.

In June 2005 I moved to the United States and briefly worked at the University of Louisville as Assistant Professor. During this time, I established a second model system, the primary culture of ocular nonpigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells and expanded my work to lens physiology. In 2006, I moved to the University of Arizona and presently working as Associate Professor. I published a large number of peer reviewed papers in many reputed journals with significant contribution to ocular physiology and pharmacology research. The outstanding discoveries are:  (1) role for transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) in lens physiology, (2) Src tyrosine kinase regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity in the NPE and in the lens epithelium, (3) interaction between TRPV4 and connexin 50 hemichannel that constitute a unique remote-control signaling mechanism in the lens and (4) TRPV4 and TRPV1 mediated two reciprocal feedback control mechanism that regulate ion and water homeostasis in the lens.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,NA,NA,Physiology,Associate Professor,NA,1,public,2019-09-11,2006,07,01,NA,NA,NA

Joshua D,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,Sherman,NA,,0000-0002-4084-035X,"As an Associate Area Agent in Commercial Horticulture for Cochise, Graham, and Santa Cruz counties of Arizona, Joshua Sherman's primary responsibility is to provide research-based educational programs that have a positive influence on the production of intensively cultivated commercial nut and fruit trees, grapevines, and other specialty cash crops (i.e., organic vegetable, chile peppers, potato). This agent's main priority is in promoting a strong community via scientific research and extension outreach programs for the successful adoption of sustainable management practices and profitable crops, and further help protect the livelihoods and investments of food crop producers. Horticulture requires a focus on a diversity of disciplines, such as plant pathology (disease), soil science, mineral nutrition (fertilizing), entomology (insects), weed science, sustainable production, integrated pest management, weather, and climate, etc. Through these program efforts, these agents’ connections are made across these disciplines both within the state of Arizona and outside the state, and international collaborations. With specialists and food producers themselves, problem-solving research is conducted to address producers’ questions or current issues. Results are shared through publications, workshops and conferences, and smaller individual/group, on-farm interactions. This agent will have the capacity and the network to help a student navigate on-farm agriculture projects and provide mentorship to interested students entering the agricultural plant food production systems. 
Joshua Sherman is responsible for the Commercial Horticulture Cooperative Extension program. The Commercial Horticulture of Nuts, Fruits, Vines is the University of Arizona's research and extension program focused on identifying the needs of large and small-scale crop producers in the south and southeast Arizona and providing science-based information to guide a diversity of producers in their decision making. A few primary programs include Fruit and Nut Trees (including apples, peaches, pecans, and pistachios), Viticulture (Wine Grapes), and Small Acreage (greenhouse, vegetable, and specialty crops), and Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education. The target of this commercial horticulture program is to promote sustainable local food production in Arizona by combining the expertise and experiences of local producers, agriculture professionals, and stakeholders in a joint effort to maximize the sustainable use of local resources. The program is vital to Arizona because it strives to link Cooperative Extension and University of Arizona specialists with producers and agricultural professionals statewide. Organic, biodynamic, permaculture, and other producers of various scales apply sustainable agriculture principles to food and fiber production systems in Arizona. Various marketing philosophies connect with consumers, including farmers’ markets, field stands, local markets, consumer-supported agriculture (CSA’s), farm-to-table operations, and internet sales.
Additionally, Native American authorities and community members desire to reconnect with their past agricultural heritage and seek assistance in learning and teaching concepts to understand the roots of sustainable agriculture better. Through this program, Extension Agents can interface with the Indigenous peoples’ worldviews when it comes to growing crops, sustaining ecosystem health, and caring for the community. This program also helps enhance traditional agricultural techniques and provides insight into using and promoting sustainable management approaches without co-opting or erasing the original stewardship of land views. It also helps explain the importance of respecting and trusting the indigenous knowledge of the Native American underserved communities while conducting western science and extension programs.
THE VISION: We are guided by the agriculture history of southern Arizona and motivated by the rich native cultural heritage and diversity of large to small-scale farms that remain resilient in enhancing the environment and improving the quality of life for both producers and consumers.
THE MISSION: To promote such a strong community via applied scientific research and extension outreach programs for the successful adoption of sustainable management practices and profitable crops that will enhance food security in the region, and further help protect the livelihoods and investments of the producers.
THE GOAL: To serve our various and diverse farmers, marketing managers, the USDA, and policymakers through a collaborative effort with growers in applied research and Extension education programs that utilize expertise and resources from The University of Arizona, USDA, private industry, and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs).",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,https://ror.org/03m2x1q45,ROR,"College of Agriculture, Life and Veterinary Sciences, and Cooperative Extension","Associate Agent, Commercial Horticulture Program, Western SARE State Program Co-Chair",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fextension.arizona.edu%2Fcommercial-horticulture%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0M8DMraVRzBrwwHnHaI8YV2v8OsNY3sNGlnjrP84Reyf6vyaygXVYtoPc&h=AT2w5eigqZe3rJZnJ2a325RiNFxTe4TiXZ7fCP5jCjwGN22Lwm9T51sLDKLMA9HLfnl_qVYQHqaG_8Z6vvWb1QxAM3aJgDiHp59-IxVx_TzC9ri8joiahmNP87m0DbEE1lCWIyMEv7uqI0GgCwvjtuBh73w,1,public,2022-04-22,2015,03,09,NA,NA,NA

Benjamin,2018-03-26,2018-03-26,Lawrance,NA,,0000-0001-6020-0125,"I’m a legal historian and work in Africa and with West African migrants around the globe. My research explores mobility, labor, and exploitation through time and space, and I have written about historical and contemporary slavery, human trafficking, cuisine and globalization, human rights, refugee issues and asylum policies. I am the Editor-in-Chief of the African Studies Review, the principal journal of the African Studies Association (USA).

My first monograph — Locality, Mobility and 'Nation' (Rochester 2007) — examined the experiences of Ewe men and women under French mandate rule in Togo, and will shortly appear in French. My second monograph — Amistad's Orphans (Yale 2014) — examined West African child smuggling in the 19th century, reconstructing a familiar story, namely the 1840-41 Amistad Supreme Court case, through the lens of children’s experiences of enslavement. I’m currently working on a history of postcolonial African social and political persecution, drawing on the narratives of African asylum seekers in Europe and North America. I am the series editor for the Bloomsbury Academic Press series, A Cultural History of Slavery and Human Trafficking. And with Nate Carpenter, I’m publishing the first history of exile in Africa, forthcoming with Indiana University Press in its Framing the Global Series.

Among my other recent works are those examining forced marriage, asylum, refugee issues, expert testimony, historical and contemporary trafficking in women and children in Africa. My essays have appeared in the Radical History Review, The Journal of African History, Biography, Slavery & Abolition, African Economic History, Anthropological Quarterly, Cahiers d'Études Africaines, and the African Studies Review, among others. Along with Bill Moseley, I co-chaired the 59th Annual Meeting of the African Studies Association in Washington DC in December 2016, with the theme: ""Imaging Africa at the Center: Bridging Scholarship, Policy, and Representation in African Studies.""",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,NA,US,NA,NA,History,Professor of African History,NA,0,public,2018-03-26,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

She is coauthor of the leading U.S. tort law treatise, THE LAW OF TORTS, and the leading tort law hornbook, HORNBOOK ON TORTS (both with Dan Dobbs and Paul Hayden). Her books and articles have been cited by the United States Supreme Court, courts in every federal circuit, forty-nine states, and in international jurisdictions. She has served as an Advisor on the American Law Institute’s RESTATEMENT THIRD OF REMEDIES and RESTATEMENT THIRD OF TORTS:  Intentional Torts, Liability for Economic Harm, and Coordination Projects. 

Bublick serves, with Greg Keating, as Editor of the JOURNAL OF TORT LAW, the leading scholarly journal in the Torts field. She is a Contributing Editor and former Section Editor of the JOTWELL Torts blog. She previously served as Chair of the Torts and Compensation Section of the Association of American Law Schools. 

Bublick’s other books include the widely-used casebook TORTS AND COMPENSATION:  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURY (with Paul Hayden); DOBBS ON ECONOMIC AND DIGNITARY TORTS (with Jane Bambauer and Daniel Arellano), and A CONCISE RESTATEMENT OF TORTS (on behalf of the American Law Institute). Some of her work has been translated into Chinese.

On the basis of her research, Bublick has been invited to speak to international audiences which include the Obligations Discussion Group at Oxford University; the European Group on Tort Law in Vienna, Austria; the Tort Law Research Group in Ontario, Canada; and an event co-sponsored by the Research Center for Civil and Commercial Jurisprudence of Renmin University of China. She has also been invited to speak to national audiences, which include the National Institute of Justice; The Louisiana Judicial Conference; the Pennsylvania House of Representatives; and the National Sexual Assault Law Institute. One of her innovative legal theories concerning suits involving sexual violence against children was expressly adopted by the Washington Supreme Court in Christensen v. Royal School Dist.

Robin,2020-01-26,2020-01-26,Reineke,NA,,0000-0003-3827-7032,"Robin Reineke is a sociocultural anthropologist with specializations in transnational migration, science and technology studies, human rights, forensic anthropology, and the anthropology of death. Her research and fieldwork are focused on the US-Mexico border region, especially the Sonoran Desert. Dr. Reineke’s research centers on questions relating to forensics, evidence, and care, including: What qualifies as “evidence” and who has the power to create forums where evidence is presented and discussed? How are forensic methodologies employed as a critical social practice outside of state practices of policing? What can the history of forensic anthropology reveal about the history of anthropology and race and racism in the US? How has migration along the US-Mexico border changed forensic science? What are the impacts of US border militarization on local human and nonhuman communities? 

Some of Dr. Reineke’s past research investigated the impact of border deaths and disappearances on immigrant communities, and the ways in which families of missing migrants have changed the practice of forensic science in the US-Mexico borderlands. From 2006 – 2020, she spent significant time working with the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, doing ethnographic research and collaborating in the development of various projects and initiatives to address the challenges of unidentified human remains and missing persons in the borderlands. These initiatives included development of the nonprofit, nongovernmental organization, the Colibrí Center for Human Rights, which Dr. Reineke co-founded and directed from 2013 – 2019. 

Dr. Reineke is currently working on her first book, The Forensics of Human Identification at the Border: An Ethnographic Study, which focuses on the experience of forensic authorities and volunteers as they navigated their work in an era of mass death along the U.S.-Mexico border. The book is particularly concerned with questions of how forensic scientists created procedures and practices in a gray zone between the law and ethics, between best practice and budget limitations, and between local and federal responsibility. Together with her research colleague Dr. Natalia Mendoza Rockwell, Dr. Reineke is currently working on a binational research project called Forensic Citizenship in the Borderlands. This visual, oral history, and ethnographic project is focused on understanding civilian forensic expertise and critical practice on both sides of the Arizona-Sonora border. The project is funded by the University of Arizona Libraries Digital Borderlands Program and the ConfluenceCenter for Creative Inquiry. 

Dr. Reineke is Assistant Research Social Scientist at the University of Arizona’s Southwest Center and Affiliated Faculty at the School of Anthropology and at the Department of Latin American Studies. She is a 2021 Confluence Center Faculty Fellow. She was awarded the Institute for Policy Studies’ Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award and Echoing Green’s Global Fellowship both in 2014.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,NA,NA,The Southwest Center,Assistant Research Social Scientist,https://swc.arizona.edu/,1,public,2020-01-26,2017,08,01,NA,NA,NA

Julienne,2018-03-09,2018-03-09,Rutherford,NA,,0000-0001-6536-6888,"Dr. Julienne Rutherford is John & Nell Mitchell Endowed Chair for Pediatric Nursing and Professor in the University of Arizona College of Nursing. She is a biological anthropologist whose work integrates bioanthropological theory with biomedical science. For 20 years, she has sustained a program of research exploring the intrauterine environment as a biosocial determinant of health. She studies how maternal life history and lived experience shape this earliest developmental setting, and how, in turn, the intrauterine environment influences growth, health, and development across the life course and across generations. Her innovative marmoset monkey research comprises the bulk of her 16 years of continuous federal funding as PI/MPI and Co-I (total federal awards >$6M). As Principal Investigator (PI) she designed a “Womb to Womb” NICHD-funded R01 study of marmosets to determine how prenatal influences shape female reproductive development and pregnancy outcomes across generations. She and her team have shown that in the marmoset, a mother's own birth weight and litter size are associated with her pregnancy outcomes in adulthood and the reproductive development of her daughters. She is currently funded as an MPI on an NIA-funded R56 study of marmoset developmental genetics. These studies in the marmoset demonstrate the ways maternal health and child outcomes may be shaped by events beyond the reach of individual agency. She applies this justice-informed lens to collaborate with nurse midwifery scholars to examine the relationships among experiences of Covid-19-dictated changes in care, obstetric racism, and physiological measures of stress, laying the groundwork for NIH grant submissions to implement prospective studies of the impact of obstetric racism and the lingering effects of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of mothers and their children through the first 3 years of life. Dr. Rutherford has produced 45 publications (cited over 1600 times), over 60 conference presentations, dozens of invited talks, and multiple plenary and keynote addresses at national and international meetings. She was a UIC Researcher of the Year Rising Star in Clinical Sciences, American Society of Primatologists Legacy Awardee, and National Academy of Science Kavli Foundation Fellow. Further, Dr. Rutherford has been recognized as a teacher and mentor of nursing students and faculty as a Robert Wood Johnson Future of Nursing mentor and as the recipient of the American College of Nurse Midwives Excellence in Teaching Award and multiple major teaching awards from the University of Illinois at Chicago.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,https://ror.org/03m2x1q45,ROR,College of Nursing,John & Nell Mitchell Endowed Chair for Pediatric Nursing and Professor,NA,1,public,2022-09-28,2022,08,15,NA,NA,NA

My expertise falls within computational plant sciences. I address questions in the area of plant growth and shape formation in formal and applied settings. In so doing, I have developed novel methods such as a robust skeletonization for laser scanner obtained point clouds to describe and compute the shapes of trees on various spatial scales. I apply these methods to link geometric measures in tree crowns to physiological models or analyze the phenotypic variation of root architecture under field conditions. In particular my work on describing root architecture was highlighted on the cover page of Plant Physiology and in national press articles. In addition, I work on growth simulations of organic branching structures to yield insight into the formation of branches. For example I formalized the characteristics resulting from the lateral expansion of a growing random walk to show that expansion during elongating growth processes lead to a straighter shape. Thus, geometric relations play an as vital role in the formation of organic shapes in concert with the environment and endogenous processes. My methods have been developed and validated in close collaboration with experimentalists to resolve challenges in plant biotechnology and food security, e.g., by investigating the relationship between crop plant genotype and phenotype. My projects are united by my interest in developing novel methods towards a measurable understanding of plant formation and structure, below- and above-ground.",,,,,University of Arizona,Tucson,Arizona,US,https://ror.org/03m2x1q45,ROR,School of Plant Science,Associate Professor,https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/content/alexander,1,public,2023-01-05,2023,01,03,NA,NA,NA
